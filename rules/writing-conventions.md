# CDocs Writing Conventions

All CDocs documents and communication should follow these conventions.

## BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Lead documents and substantial communications with a BLUF summary.
A good BLUF results in no surprises when the full body of work is scrutinized.
It doesn't need every detail -- just the essential takeaway.

Format: `> BLUF: ...` or `> BLUF(author/workstream): ...`

## Brevity and Communicative Efficiency

- Succinct, well-factored markdown docs are more effective than multi-section chat messages.
- Avoid repetition. Say it once, in the right place.
- Skip obvious explanations. Focus on decisions and their rationale.
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT.

## Sentence-per-Line Formatting

Use one sentence or thought per line in markdown source.
This makes diffs cleaner and editing easier.

## Callout Syntax

Use these callouts to leave context for future readers:

- `NOTE(author/workstream):` -- Context, caveats, or design commentary that doesn't belong in the main flow.
- `TODO(author/workstream):` -- Known work remaining.
- `WARN(author/workstream):` -- Risks, gotchas, or things that could break.

The parenthetical is an attribution in the format `author/workstream`, which often maps to a feature branch name.
Add slashes for subprojects: `NOTE(mjr/cdocs/hooks)`.

## History-Agnostic Framing

- Frame documents in present tense as if the current state has always been the state.
- Don't reference "previously", "now updated", "added in this version", "old approach" in the test of the document.
- If a change is very very imporant, the _previous_ approach can be put in a qualifying `> NOTE` callout.
- Exception: Devlogs document chronological work. Proposals may reference prior approaches in NOTE() callouts.

## Commentary Decoupling

Separate commentary from technical content.
When implementation diverges from design, add a NOTE callout rather than rewriting the design doc:

```md
### Some Component
> NOTE(sculptor/my-feat): Implementation has special cases not in the original design.
> See `myEdgecaseReconciler` for details.

... Original clean design documentation ...
```

## Critical and Detached Analysis

Approach and reflect on work with a realist mindset.
- Be critical and detached in analysis.
- Surface deviations and complications as high-importance.
- Track both improvements AND what was not done or could be improved.
- Never gloss over a problem or present it as a success.

## Devlog Convention

Always create a devlog when starting substantive work.
The devlog is the single source of truth for a work session.
Update it as you go, not at the end.

## Avoid Emojis

Avoid excessive use of emojis and overly-effusive language in all documentation.
