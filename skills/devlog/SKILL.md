# CDocs Devlog

Create a development log for the current work session.

**Usage:** Claude should auto-invoke this skill when starting substantive work (triggered by the "always create a devlog" writing convention).
The user can also invoke it directly.
Model auto-invocation is the most common entry point.

## Invocation

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` provides a feature name, use it. Otherwise, infer from context or prompt the user.
2. Determine today's date.
3. Create `cdocs/devlogs/YYYY-MM-DD_feature_name.md` using the template below.
4. If `cdocs/devlogs/` doesn't exist, suggest running `/cdoc:init` first.

## Template

Use the template in `template.md` alongside this skill file.
Fill in:
- `first_authored.by` with the current model name (e.g., `@claude-opus-4-5-20251101`) or `@username` for human authors.
- `first_authored.at` with the current timestamp including timezone.
- `task_list` with the relevant workstream path.
- `type: devlog`, `state: live`, `status: wip`.
- Tags relevant to the work.

## Sections

All devlogs should include an Objective, Plan, and Verification section.
Most devlogs should include the other sections as well, but use your judgement (a quick config change doesn't need a debugging process section).
You should also include novel sections as is appropriate/useful for your work.

- **Objective:** What needs to be accomplished and why.
- **Plan:** Step-by-step approach.
- **Testing Approach:** TDD? Integration tests? Manual verification? State it upfront.
  - Skipping test-first for prototyping? Acknowledge it: "Rapid prototyping without test-first, will add coverage after."
  > NOTE: _Strongly_ lean away from skipping testing or relying on manual testing.
- **Implementation Notes:** Technical decisions (why, brief summaries of what) and issues solved.
- **Debugging Process:** Systematic debugging using the 4-phase approach below.
- **Changes Made:** Table of files modified/created with brief descriptions.
- **Testing:** Build verification and test results.
- **Screenshots:** Visual changes with captions. Save to `cdocs/_media/YYYY-MM-DD_description.png`.
- **Documentation Updated:** Checklist of docs changed.
- **Verification:** Fresh evidence of completion. No completion claims without pasted evidence.

## Debugging Process (Bug Fixes)

When fixing bugs, document systematic debugging phases:

**Phase 1 - Root Cause Investigation:**
- Evidence gathered at each component boundary.
- Race condition timing captured.

**Phase 2 - Pattern Analysis:**
- What works vs. what's broken.
- Similar working examples compared.

**Phase 3 - Hypothesis Tested:**
- One hypothesis at a time with instrumentation.
- Results of each test.

**Phase 4 - Fix Implemented:**
- Final fix with verification.
- If 3+ fixes failed: architectural questions raised.

## Verification Section

No completion claims without pasted evidence.

**Build & Lint:**
```
[Paste full build/lint output]
```

**Tests:**
```
[Paste test output with pass counts]
```

**Runtime Verification:**
- Screenshot or description of actual behavior.
- For UI changes: before/after screenshots.

Remember:
- A task is not complete until its been fully tested and the test output has been verified.
- Incomplete or deferred work, while best avoided, _must at least_ be surfaced at a high-level so it isn't buried or forgotten about. 

## Parallel Agent Documentation

When dispatching parallel agents for multi-failure debugging, document in "Issues Encountered and Solved":

```markdown
### Multi-subsystem failures after [CHANGE]
- N failures across M subsystems
- Dispatched N parallel agents to investigate independently
- Agent 1 (subsystem): [findings and fix]
- Agent 2 (subsystem): [findings and fix]
- All fixes integrated, full suite green
```

## Best Practices

- Start the devlog when beginning work. Update as you go, not at the end.
- Be concise but sufficiently detailed on decisions. Explain WHY, not just what.
- Note what didn't work and why.
- Make the devlog the single source of truth for the work session.
- Ensure the devlog contains enough context for another agent to resume the work.

## Handoff devlogs

Some work prepped from the initial planner or an earlier implementer with context and references to earlier docs.
When these are written and read, it should be kept in mind that they should _not_ try to cover every point themselves, but _should_ provide enough context and references to do so as needed.
